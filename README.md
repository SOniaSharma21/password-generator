# password-generator
this program is a simple password generator that creates a random password with 10 characters, including letters,and  numbers. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the user interface and generate the password.

 The JavaScript code is responsible for generating the password and updating the input field when the "Generate" button is clicked.
   - The generatePassword() function generates a random password by selecting 10 random characters from a predefined character set.
   - The event listener on the "Generate" button calls the createPassword() function and updates the value of the input field with the new password.
